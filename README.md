# ReapBook

A small hybrid mobile application built on Flutter platform. I have used simple Dart I/O and BLoC pattern in order to fetch the data and show the results on the UI.

This application demostrate GET/PUT/POST/DELETE network call and build the different dynamic UI using the Material and Cupertino UI component.

In this application I am using a free fake API named [JSONPlaceHolder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ "JSONPlaceHolder"). Although POST, PUT and DELETE resources would be not updated as this is a fake API.

### Third Part Libs
I also used a few third-party library dependency in order to make the app good look and feel.

- Modal Bottom Sheet (https://pub.dev/packages/modal_bottom_sheet)
- Slidable List View (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable)
- Equatable (https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)

### How to run?
Checkout the code and run `flutter run`. Make sure any android or iOS device should be connected to the IDE.
